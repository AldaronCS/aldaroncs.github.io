# Learn HTML

First, we'll start with the boilerplate code (What we need to type to get anywhere).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
	<title>My Website</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
```

Just copy the above code into a text file called `index.html` and then open it in Firefox.
