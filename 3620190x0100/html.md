# Learn HTML

First, we'll start with the boilerplate code (What we need to type to get anywhere).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
	<title>My Website</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
```

Just copy the above code into a text file called `index.html` and then open it in Firefox.

## What does it meanâ€½
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
	<title>My Website</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
```

A tag is any text surrounded by `<>`

```html
<tag>
    <tag/>
</tag>
```

Head is page properties.

Body is page content.
